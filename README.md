### About Me

💻 I'm a final-year student majoring in **Information Technology and Computer Networks**.
  
I develop desktop and mobile apps using Python, and I'm always learning new tools and technologies.  

🌐 I have previous experience in "digital marketing" , particularly "SEO" and content strategy.  

🔐 I'm deeply interested in "cybersecurity" and currently exploring that field.

📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aynur-rashidnasl-4385a92b5)  

🗣 I speak Turkish (Istanbul & Azerbaijani), Persian, and English.  

Fun fact: If I start something, I *will* finish it — unless I disappear into the Matrix 👀
